# Project Title

GitHub Repo Search Tool 

## Description

This is a GitHub repository search application that uses the GitHub search API. The user inputs a search term and the application displays the results of that query. The results can further be filtered by Language as well as sorted by Best Match (default mode) or by Stargazer Count. When a user clicks into one of the results, they are routed to a new page that shows further details on specific application.

### Technologies Used

The app was built using React, React Router DOM, React Bootstrap, React Icons and the Github Search API (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/search#search-repositories). 

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
